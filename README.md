# Build a Chatbot to Analyze PDF Files using LLM 🤗🤗🤗
#### Chatbot is a software application designed to communicate like a human. They can respond to text input from users and are widely used in various fields, including customer service, e-commerce, and education.
#### Large Language Models (LLM), or Model Bahasa Besar, are the latest achievement in the field of artificial intelligence that harnesses machine learning technology to understand and generate text with a high level of complexity. LLM brings unique capabilities to process and comprehend linguistic contexts in various languages, as well as produce text that is often indistinguishable from human writing.
#### This project aims to instruct and guide us through the implementation of Building a Chatbot to Analyze PDF Files using LLM.
